# Multimedia Coding

Project and exercises implemented in the multimedia coding course

Project: Develop dictionary based coding and decoding procedures according to the LZ77 algorithm. 
Then use your procedures to compress different kind of data, e.g, text, audio (mono, 8 bit/sample), images
(grayscale).
Analize the performances (in terms of compression efficiency) as a function of the size of the sliding window.
Compare the performances of your procedures with those of the standard compression tool available on your
computer (e.g., zip, gzip).
Extend the procedures implementing the LZSS variation and repeat the experimental tests and comparisons.
